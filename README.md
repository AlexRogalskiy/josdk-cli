=======

This CLI tool provides features to make building operators with [javaoperatorsdk](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/java-operator-sdk) even easier.

## How to use

The project is currently under active development, hence you need to build from the code. The native & jar binaries will be provided as soon as the features are stable enough to release the first version.

### How to build

mvn clean package
```

### How to run

Running the following command will show what commands are already supported by the CLI.

java -jar target/jops.jar 
```
